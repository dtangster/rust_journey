# Rust Journey

This is a collection of code that I have developed to gain more insight into the Rust programming language.

## Hurdles

It is amazing how I can get stuck trying to perform basic tasks like

* calling a function
* assigning a variable
* returning a collection

because my program won't compile.

## Learnings

TBD
